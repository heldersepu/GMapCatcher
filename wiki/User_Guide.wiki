Users can choose their preferred map and watch it while online. All viewed map section will be stored on disk and may be viewed offline. Additionally a downloading tool is provided which saves a user defined area to disk for offline viewing.

= User interface =

After starting the programme the GUI shows the map, a small size scroll bar on the left and a toolbar on top. 

http://gmapcatcher.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/snapshot.gif

By using the scroll bar the resolution/scale of the map can be changed. The toolbar consists of two rows and offers the following actions and settings (first row to second row, left to right):
  * *Main configuration button*
  Pressing the button opens a drop down menu with 5 configuration categories. Choosing one of them opens the complete programme setup where the chosen category is active. In addition there is the 'Save Path Maps' Menu item that makes the visual path download tool visible; see the description of the visual path download for details

  * *Drop down menu/edit field for new and stored locations*
  By using the drop down menu one of the stored locations is selected. By entering text a place with this name is searched (currently only available if online).

  * *Confirmation button*
  Confirms entered text in drop down menu/edit field (alternative to pressing 'ENTER' in edit field).

  * *Check box to indicate working mode (online or offline)*

  * *Check box to indicate force update facility*

  * *Download configuration button*
 
  Pressing this button opens a window to download a map section. See description 'Download configuration' below.

  * *Drop down menu for map type selection (Map, Terrain, Satellite, Hybrid)*
  One of the four map types (Map, Terrain, Satellite, Hybrid) may be selected; the Google Maps hybrid satellite plus labels overlay is now supported.

== Download configuration ==
  Within the following dialog an area and a zoom level to download a map section can be entered. The dialog stays alive during the download.

    http://gmapcatcher.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/GMap-Download.jpg

  The centre of the downloaded area is defined by entering latitude and longitude. The size of the area by entering width and height. The maximum and minimum zoom level define the scale of the downloaded map tiles. The map type which is set in the drop down menu for 'map type selection' is used for the download.

  Action of buttons in bottom line of window:
    * left button: Start download
    * middle button: Open menu to restart/continue a previous download
    * right button: Cancel current download.

  How to update and/or modify a downloaded area? If you have e.g. downloaded the complete US with zoom level 4, now you want to update the NY area with zoom level 2, then you open the Download Window, simply enter the coordinates for NY and set the zoom level to 2, the range width and height to 50km and start the download. Now the NY area is updated the rest remains the same and the complete US is still available for offline viewing with zoom level 4 while NY is available with zoom level 2.

== Right mouse click ==

While displaying a map a right mouse click opens the following menu:

http://gmapcatcher.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/gmap_rclick.png

The first four items change the map section display and explain themselves: 
    * Zoom In: Decrease zoom
    * Zoom Out: Increase zoom
    * Center map here: Position of cursor becomes centre of map.
    * Reset: Display map with highest zoom level.

Actions of the next three items:
    * Batch Download: See description [http://code.google.com/p/gmapcatcher/wiki/User_Guide#Download_configuration Download configuration]
    * [http://code.google.com/p/gmapcatcher/wiki/User_Guide#Export_map_to_image Export Map]: Open dialog to save current display of map to file 'map.png' in home folder
    * Add Marker: Add a marker at position of cursor (description of marker must be done afterwards by using the main configuration menu)

Actions of the final 2 items:
    * Copy Location: copy mouse location of right-click to the clipboard
    * Copy GPS: copy GPS location to the clipboard
    you may then paste locations from the clipboard as needed
    
== Visual path download ==
  When the visual path download tool is visible, it describes the area that would be included in a visual download.
  
http://gmapcatcher.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/visual_download.png
  
    * Shift+Scroll changes the size of the area
    * Ctrl+Scroll changes the minimum zoom level to download
  
  When you *Shift+drag* the map, then the area included in the visual download zone is queued for download, from the zoom level below the current view zoom level, to the visual download's minimum zoom level as set
  
  One main function of the tool is to allow you to download close-up maps along a path; it gives feedback of the number of tiles downloaded/requested while downloading

== Drawing paths ==

Paths in GMapCatcher can be used to measure distances and draw paths to follow while navigating.

You can start drawing a path by pressing F7. This activates the ruler and you can left-click on any point of the map to add a point to the path. 

If you make a mistake, press delete to remove last point. You can zoom and move map normally when creating a path.

The path shows segment length and the whole path length (up to that point) on every point of the path. After you finish drawing the path, just press F7 again to close the tool. You then have a choice to use path as a track or dismiss it. If you choose to use it as track, it will be shown on the map until you close GMapCatcher or hide the track through Track control.

= Tools menu =
== Operations ==

=== Track control ===

Track control allows controlling of tracks shown in the map. Through this window you can also import and export tracks, as well as export GPS track. GMapCatcher uses GPX-files to store this information.

Toggling the tracks also toggles the tracks shown on the map.

With import tracks you can import tracks and routes from GPX-files. You can export selected tracks to a GPX-file with "Export selected tracks" -button. Note that this exports all the selected tracks to a single file, so if you want to export them seperately, select only one track at a time. By selecting "Export GPS track" you can export the current GPS-trace to GPX-file (only available if GPS and GPS-track drawing is active).

Below is Track control window being used to show one of the drawn ruler paths and one track from imported file.

== Settings ==

All values in the tab Settings describe display properties when starting the programme. Therefore any change requires a restart of the programme in order to have effect.

'Size' defines the display size of the GMapCatcher window. 'Zoom' defines the zoom level of the map section specified by the coordinates of the field 'Center', which is displayed on start up.
'Language' defines the language of the map's labels (street, region, etc.), the language of the user interface remains unchanged. The button 'Use Currents' sets all values according to the current display.
